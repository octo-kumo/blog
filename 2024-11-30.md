First time ever being part of a CTF's hosting team!

I made the following challenges.
- Simpler RSA #beginner
- World Wide Flags #misc
- Bongcloud #misc
- Just Lattice #crypto
- Ransom Waifu #rev

The writeups are over [here](/c/ctf/2024-wwctf)

I was making a web challenge, but there were issues with puppeteer and I couldn't finish it ðŸ˜¢.

ngl, hosting CTF is quite a unique experience, it feels really good when someone say they like my challenge.
