Let's say you need web monitoring on your fancy new VPS running alpine linux, it is so light you barely feel it.

You want to squeeze out the use of every last byte on your tiny 1GB memory, (which is why you want monitoring in the first place).

Cool, so how much RAM does the monitoring itself take?

| Method         | Disk Size                  | Memory RSS                               | CPU (idle / per-req)                                       | Dependencies                                                                                                                                                               |

Ouch! That is a lot of memory! Using 10% to 40% of your entire system's memory just for monitoring? They may also require tons of dependencies, who would want that!

Even the smaller ones require more than 1 megabyte of memory! That is more than 1/60 of the OS itself!

Who needs all that information? All you want is just a progress bar telling you how much free ram is left.

Hence, I set out to find / make the smallest, least featured monitoring tool out there.

## Results

| Method                    | Disk Size                 | Memory RSS | CPU (idle / per-req) | Dependencies                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **BusyBox `httpd` + CGI** | 64 KiB (`busybox-extras`) | 932 KB     | 0 %                  | `busybox-extras` for `httpd` |

> You know what, this can be further slimmed down by removing httpd from the mix, but that's up to you.

```bash
docker-slave:/srv/www/cgi-bin$ top -b | grep httpd
 4049  3957 alpine   S     1624   0%   1   0% grep httpd
 3386     1 root     S      932   0%   0   0% /usr/sbin/httpd -p 80 -h /srv/www -c cgi-bin/
```

## How to do it?

### 1. Install `httpd`

Makes life easier for us.

```bash
doas apk update
doas apk add busybox-extras
```

### 2. Create the cgi-bin folder

> This folder can be named whatever tbh.

```bash
doas mkdir -p /srv/www/cgi-bin
```

### 3. Add the monitoring script

> Customize this to your heart's content!

```bash
doas tee /srv/www/cgi-bin/top.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
printf 'Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n'
echo "=== Memory Usage ==="
free -h

echo
echo "=== Disk Usage (root fs) ==="
df -h /

echo
echo "=== Uptime ==="
uptime

echo
echo "=== CPU Usage ==="
top -d 1 -n 1 \
  | sed -r 's/\x1B\[[0-9;]*[A-Za-z]//g' \
  | grep '^CPU:'
EOF
doas chmod +x /srv/www/cgi-bin/top.sh
```

### 4. Start it up!

```bash
doas tee /etc/init.d/httpd << 'EOF'
#!/sbin/openrc-run
description="Monitoring Service"
command="/usr/sbin/httpd"
command_args="-p 80 -h /srv/www -c cgi-bin/"
depend() {
  need net
}
EOF

doas chmod +x /etc/init.d/httpd
doas rc-update add httpd default
doas rc-service httpd restart
```

**Done!**

Now you can visit your host at `http://<your-server>/cgi-bin/top.sh` to view your server's raw data!

```
=== Memory Usage ===
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available

=== Uptime ===

=== CPU Usage ===

```

## Next steps

Does this look *too* barebones?

Well I am ok with it, however you can write a static page and put it under `/srv/www`, have it request data from `/cgi-bin/top.sh` like an API, and make the client spend the compute power to store the data (localStorage maybe) and render it!

You can also add the full table from `top`, it might not be secure, but you will have more data!

You may also want to switch out `top` for maybe `/proc/stat` or something similar. I was too lazy for that lol.

You might also want to change `httpd` to something else, like your own compiled binary.

Many ways!

Say no to bloated monitoring software!
